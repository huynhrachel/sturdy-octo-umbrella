Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I’ve completed most of the core pygame. I built the Tkinter window, added player movement with both arrow keys and WASD, created collectible items that appear on the board, and implemented score tracking and basic collision detection. The main loop and interactions all work. The game is fully playable in its simple form.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I still need to implement the countdown timer, add visual polish (colors, layout, and clearer win/lose messages). I also plan to adjust spacing and animations to make the game feel smoother.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

My project idea is simple, so my main concern is whether its simplicity will affect my grade. I haven’t had major technical issues. My only concern is that my project might be a bit simple, and I’m not fully sure how the rubric handles that.
